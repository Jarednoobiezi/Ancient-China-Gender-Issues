        One of the most prevalent and current issues in China is the fact that women were primarily limited to activities that could be done at home, like
        weaving, and had no legal rights to property other than those related to their dowries. The widespread practice of foot-binding, which hindered women
        from standing or walking, highlighted the gender imbalance.

      <p class="default">
        Women have no rights or freedom. The society views them from the wrong perspective: that they are weak and incapable. Women experienced sexist treatment
        such as men lurking at their bodies for pleasures. They experienced inequality, prejudice, and being deprived of privileges.Gender Issues during
        historical times are mostly experienced by women especially in Ancient China times.

        Women in Ancient China did not enjoy status and they were restricted in participating in various realms of social life, through social stipulations that
        they remained indoors, whilst outside business were conducted hold men.

      <p class="default">
        Due to the fact that only men in ancient China have the authority to own assets and tangible property, women do not have any legal rights to property or
        dowries. They were primarily limited to jobs that could be done at home, like weaving. The widespread practice of foot binding, which prohibited women
        from standing or walking, made this easier.

        In ancient China, women were only allowed to work (weave). They limit the split of the sexes, which is shown in the Zhou dynasty's "men plow, women
        weave" policy that divided male and female histories.Because weaving was the only occupation available to women in these ancient times, they were always
        expected to do this.

        Women were prohibited from participating in various aspects of social life in ancient and imperial China due to social norms that mandated they remain
        indoors while men were expected to conduct outside business. Women were also prevented from demonstrating their capacity to lead the state due to a lack
        of state affairs and people's perceptions that women should stay at home caring for their children and doing housework.

        Gender issues were prevalent during historical times—imperial and ancient times. Especially during Ancient Chinese where gender issues are mostly
        experienced by women. Women at that time had no legal rights to property, which nowadays can be solved by providing a law to give women a right to
        tangible properties just like what men have. Moreover, Chinese women during ancient times were also restricted to work, they are not entitled to do what
        men do, as well as to get an opportunity to avail what men do. Since these women were restricted to work, they were limited in weaving and other
        household jobs as their primary role as a woman, as an intervention to that, laws that have a provision on equity and equality on job and career
        opportunity. Overpowering men is belittling women, as stated in the 4th and 5th .whys, giving men a lot of opportunities and accessibility is indirectly
        proportional to what women receives, gender empowerment and government support programs are useful in order to establish firm understanding regarding
        social and gender biases and divisions

      <p class="default">
         All of the problems and issues being encountered by Chinese women were all because of downgrading and invalidating women’s ability and character. This
         will be solved through gender empowerment and proper government support. Giving them a voice to speak will give them an opportunity to gain power and
         acquire and experience what men do. Career and jobs will be equally given by proper gender empowerment and promoting a good division of genders roles.
         According to T. Manahan (2017), opening and giving enough awareness to young minds will enable the society to lessen gender discrimination and
         inequality. Also, M. Balingasa (2020), educating the society and its people will allow all gender preferences to access all the opportunities and be
         treated equally. This only means that establishing good education and awareness would also establish firm and equal gender treatment.

        Ways to Improve Gender Equality
      </p>
      <p class="default">
        Discuss Gender equality with friends and family, talk about the ways women continue to be underrepresented in government and commerce and the positive
        potential impact of closing the gender gap. Promote Gender Equality at home by encouraging the fair division of labor for household chores. Everyone is
        capable of cooking, cleaning, childcare, and other unpaid labor it takes to keep a home and family.
        Over a billion women around the world are excluded from financial systems. Financial inclusion can help increase women’s incomes, which can lead to
        increases in household spending on food and education and an improved quality of life. Promoting financial inclusion among women can help provide women
        with the opportunities to start businesses, get an education, and increase their independence and agency. It is a practice that helps one woman at a
        time gain traction to improve their lives while creating benefits that reverberate throughout communities.

        Share household chores and childcare. In household chores and childcare every adult should be responsible.
        Based on an article women are mostly doing all the work in most countries. People should think of a way for all adults to do chores and child care
        equally.Watch signs of domestic violence, get some help and support if you know a friend or acquaintance is suffering from domestic violence or other
        abuse. This type  of violence is not restricted to physical aggression. Verbal attacks (curses and threats) and psychological abuse (controlling,
        manipulative and intimidating behavior) also affect women. Often, all these things occur together. If you experience domestic violence, be aware that
        you are not alone. Report it! Support  mothers and parents, Those responsible for children and teens need support in every society. Offering the bus
        seat to a pregnant woman, advocating the installation of children’s changing rooms in all bathrooms in shopping centers(not only in the women's
        facilities) and asking that companies guarantee maternity and paternity leave are all necessary actions.The latest UN data, released in 2015, shows that
        only 53 percent of countries offer at least 14 weeks of maternity leave. Even worse, only 48 percent of countries offer any paternity leave.

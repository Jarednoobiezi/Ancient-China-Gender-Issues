        One of the most prevalent and current issues in China is the fact that women were primarily limited to activities that could be done at home, like
        weaving, and had no legal rights to property other than those related to their dowries. The widespread practice of foot-binding, which hindered women
        from standing or walking, highlighted the gender imbalance.

      <p class="default">
        Women have no rights or freedom. The society views them from the wrong perspective: that they are weak and incapable. Women experienced sexist treatment
        such as men lurking at their bodies for pleasures. They experienced inequality, prejudice, and being deprived of privileges.Gender Issues during
        historical times are mostly experienced by women especially in Ancient China times.

        Women in Ancient China did not enjoy status and they were restricted in participating in various realms of social life, through social stipulations that
        they remained indoors, whilst outside business were conducted hold men.

    <div>
      <p class="default">
        Due to the fact that only men in ancient China have the authority to own assets and tangible property, women do not have any legal rights to property or
        dowries. They were primarily limited to jobs that could be done at home, like weaving. The widespread practice of foot binding, which prohibited women
        from standing or walking, made this easier.

      <p class="default">
        In ancient China, women were only allowed to work (weave). They limit the split of the sexes, which is shown in the Zhou dynasty's "men plow, women
        weave" policy that divided male and female histories.Because weaving was the only occupation available to women in these ancient times, they were always
        expected to do this.

      <p class="default">
        Women were prohibited from participating in various aspects of social life in ancient and imperial China due to social norms that mandated they remain
        indoors while men were expected to conduct outside business. Women were also prevented from demonstrating their capacity to lead the state due to a lack
        of state affairs and people's perceptions that women should stay at home caring for their children and doing housework.
